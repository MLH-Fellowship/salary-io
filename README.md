## Motivation
Whether we're job searching or have an offer in hand, knowing what salary we should be paid is a critical part of our career journey. Our tool uses regression modeling to quickly predict a salary estimate based on your position, location, and years of experience.

## What it does
Our app allows you to enter some information such as years of experience, gender and location about yourself and it will predict your salary based on a linear regression model trained by real world data. 

## Challenges we ran into
The machine learning part is the most challenging. None of us have much experience in machine learning and we spent a lot of time trying to identify the best dataset and which model to use. We trained both a sklearn linear regression model and a keras DNN model but their performance are similar.
