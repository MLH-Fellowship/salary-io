## Motivation
Whether you're job searching or have an offer in hand, knowing what salary you should be paid is important. Our tool takes into account where you live, your title, and how many years you have been working to estimate a salary that you can use as a reference throughout your career journey.

## What it does
Our app allows you to enter some information such as years of experience, gender and location about yourself and it will predict your salary based on a linear regression model trained by real world data. 

## Challenges we ran into
None of us have much experience in machine learning and we spent a lot of time trying to identify the best dataset and which model to use. We used salary data from Levels.fyi. It was difficult to train a model using user-reported data, which contains a lot of noise and inaccuracies that led to a lot of variance. We trained both a sklearn linear regression model and a keras DNN model but their performance was similar.
